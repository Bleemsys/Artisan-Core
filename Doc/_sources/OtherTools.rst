There are a few recommended open source tools for designing lattice structure with Artisan. Please be aware of the licenses of these software as they may be charge for commercial applications. 

Salome Platform: https://www.salome-platform.org/

This is a general CAD platform that integrates many useful features for CAD modelling, FEA/CFD mesh generation etc.. Artisan requires meshing inputs to create mesh lattice and conformal lattice. User may install Salome to create their own mesh. 

Paraview: https://www.paraview.org/

The geometric model of lattice infill could be easily reach to a level of over 1 GB. Paraview loads, manipulates and browsers the large models with the minimum lagging experiences.  

Gmsh: http://gmsh.info/

A popular open source mesher for FEA/CFD modelling community. It charges license fees for commercial application. It is lightweight and easy to use.
